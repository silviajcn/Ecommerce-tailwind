## ⚙️ Changes made:

In this project I wanted to make some changes to practice some logic issues and to add some improvements to the final project of the [Curso de React.js con Vite.js y TailwindCSS](https://platzi.com/cursos/react-vite-tailwindcss/) taught by the teacher [Estefany Aguilar](https://platzi.com/profes/teffcode/). These are the changes I made:
- Allow the user to navigate and perform actions on the page and that this information persists in case the page is closed. I did this by sending the information to Local Storage.
- Remove all products from the cart.
- Routes for the shopping cart and for the detail of the selected product.
- I used a JSON file containing the products, instead of the Platzi API. This allowed me to see a more complete detail of each product with more information.
